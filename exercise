Here is some yaml for an nginx deployment:

apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2 
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
1. Create the deployment.

2. Which nodes are the pods running on. How can you tell?

3. Update the deployment to use the 1.8 version of the nginx container and roll it out.

4. Update the deployment to use the 1.9.1 version of the nginx container and roll it out.

5. Roll back the deployment to the 1.8 version of the container.

6. Remove the deployment
