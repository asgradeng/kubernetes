1. Examine the current status of your cluster. Are all the nodes ready? How do you know?

The command kubectl get nodes will give the current status of all nodes.

2. Are there any pods running on node 2 of your cluster? How can you tell?

You can get this information in a variety of ways:

kubectl describe node node-name
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide will list all pods and which nodes they are currently running on.

3. Is the master node low on memory currently? How can you tell?

kubectl describe node node-2-name will list DiskPressure and MemoryPressure statuses so you can see how it is doing.

4. What pods are running in the kube-system namespace? What command did you use to find out?

 kubectl get pods -n kube-system will provide the desired results.
